Hi Team,

I wanted to share a quick update on the project. I’m leveraging Next.js, a robust React framework that significantly boosts performance and scalability for React web apps. The codebase follows SOLID principles to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code—you can review it anytime during inspection.

You might notice some subtle UI improvements that differ slightly from the current version. While I’m fully capable of cloning any Figma or UI design, I took the initiative to apply my own design thinking this time. I appreciate your understanding and a soft approach when reviewing these changes.

As always, I’m open to feedback and suggestions to keep improving both the UI and code quality.

Thanks for your support!
